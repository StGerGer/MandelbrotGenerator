# MandelbrotGenerator
A simple generator for the mandelbrot set. Includes a "smart generation" function that will find an interesting picture for you.

Requires Python 2.7 and Pyforms and PIL for 2.7.

**Important note:** The program will seem to freeze while looking for a picture or generating a picture. IT IS NOT FROZEN! Just be patient - to generate a full res desktop picture, your computer has to do more than a billion calculations, and I have yet to multithread this.
